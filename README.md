# omini--directional-Mecanum
Using C/C++ i was able to develop an iot remote controlled omni-directional Vehicle capable of maneuvering and picking up objects from a remote view while saving its motion in real-time   
# Omnidirectional Robot and Robotic Arm Project
Overview
This project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller to control an omnidirectional robot and a robotic arm. The robot is able to move in any direction, while the robotic arm can be used to manipulate objects.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino microcontroller
Omnidirectional robot base
Robotic arm
Motors and servos for both the robot and arm
Power supply (battery or AC adapter)
Jumper wires and breadboard for wiring
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/software)
Library for controlling the motors and servos (such as the Adafruit Motor Shield library)
Getting Started
Clone or download the project from GitHub to your computer.
Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
Wire the motors and servos for both the robot and arm according to the wiring diagrams in the project code.
Power on the robot and arm.
Test the movement of the robot and arm by running the code on the Arduino.
